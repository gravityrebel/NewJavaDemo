- JLayer is a universal decorator for Swing components which enables you to implement various advanced
painting effects as well as receive notifications of all AWTEvents generated within its borders.

JLayer delegates the handling of painting and input events to a LayerUI object,
which performs the actual decoration.

- The zip file system provider introduced in the Java SE 7 release is an implementation of a custom
file system provider. The zip file system provider treats a zip or JAR file as a file system and
provides the ability to manipulate the contents of the file. The zip file system provider creates
multiple file systems â€” one file system for each zip or JAR file.

- The fork/join framework, which is based on the ForkJoinPool class, is an implementation of the
Executor interface. It is designed to efficiently run a large number of tasks using a pool of
worker threads. A work-stealing technique is used to keep all the worker threads busy, to take
full advantage of multiple processors. See Fork/Join in The Java Tutorials.

FORK/JOIN IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXECUTOR THREAD SERVICE. IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT EXECUTORS
AND STILL CREATE THREADS MANUALLY, PLEASE GO BACK AND REVIEW EXECUTORS FROM JAVA 5.
FORK/JOIN IS THE BASIS UPON WHICH .parallel() WORKS IN JAVA 8.

- JAXP was added to Java 7. The Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) enables applications to parse,
transform, validate, and query XML documents using an API that is independent of a particular
XML processor implementation.
